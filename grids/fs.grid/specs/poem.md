#oh God!,i Seek you!

sing aloud to my God, oh earth
recite a beautiful psalm to his hearing
fill him with the most beautiful praise
for my God and Lord deserves more beyond wonder
praise my God, oh Zion, praise the Lord, Our God and King!

#Forever oh God!,i wait for you!

with joy unseizing upon this earth
to see you, know you and walk with you
for by you i have found where i belong
in your presence oh God, Lord and father
