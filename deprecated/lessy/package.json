  "readme": "# Lessy \n\tIs Less-Touch reborn to be more functional and fast and less redundant\n\n#Install \n\t' npm install lessy '\n\n#Example\n\t\"\n\t\tvar lessy = require('lessy');\n\t\t//get a lessy object, it requires two arguments\n\t\t\t-\toutput : where you wish your generated css files to be saved\n\t\t\t- imports : where you keep your other less files( usually in the same as the less folder,if u seprate your less files though(note thats a bad idea generally)),supply the directory path so it can handle less @imports directives\n\n\t\tvar compiler = lessy('./css','./less');\n\t\t\n\t\t//to watch a single file\n\t\tcompiler.sync('./less/style.less');\n\t\t\n\t\t//supply a second arguments if u wish to rename the file\n\t\tcompiler.sync('./less/style.less','styledup.css');\n\t\t\n\t\t//to watch a directory\n\t\tcompiler.syncDir('./less');\n\n\t\t//if u wish to change the update timer( the interval it watches the files and folders)\n\t\t\n\t\tcompiler.ms = 1000; //make it one second,instead of half the second(500) default time\n\n\t\t//then startup your compiler\n\t\tcompiler.bootup();\n\t\"\n# Features\n\t- capable of watching only a single file\n\t- capable of dealing with @import directives by requiring you to specify your location for your less files\n\t- capable of watching a directory and updating itself with the lists of files added\n\t- a better time based loop \n\n# License: Released under Mit Licence\n\"\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 - 2012 Christoph Martens\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the\nSoftware, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject\nto the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies\nor substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
